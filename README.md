# Diagonal Difference

Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix is shown below:

```txt
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

The left-to-right diagonal is equal to `1 + 5 + 9 = 15`. The right-to-left diagonal is equal to `3 + 5 + 7 = 15`. Their absolute difference is `|15 - 15| = 0`.

Complete the `calculate_diagonal_difference` function below. It MUST return an integer representing the absolute diagonal difference.

```python
def calculate_diagonal_difference(matrix):
    """
    Return the absolute diagonal difference of the specified matrix.

    @param matrix: a Python array representing a n-by-n square matrix such
        as for instance::

            [[0, 1, 2, 3],
             [5, 6, 7, 8],
             [9, 8, 7, 6],
             [5, 4, 3, 2]]

    @return: an integer representing the absolute diagonal difference
        of the specified matrix.
    """
    pass
```
